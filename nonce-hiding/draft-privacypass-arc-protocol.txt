1.  Introduction

   [ARCHITECTURE] describes the Privacy Pass architecture, and
   [ISSUANCE] and [AUTHSCHEME] describe the issuance and redemption
   protocols for basic Privacy Pass tokens, i.e., those computed using
   blind RSA signatures (as specified in [BLIND-RSA]) or verifiable
   oblivious pseudorandom functions (as specified in [VOPRFS]).  These
   protocols are widely deployed in practice for a variety of
   applications, including anonymous authentication for protocols such
   as Oblivious HTTP [OHTTP] and the Distributed Aggregation Protocol
   [DAP].  While effective, these variants of Privacy Pass tokens are
   limited in that each token can only be spent once.  These are often
   calle "one-time-use" tokens.  This means that applications which wish
   to limit access to a given user, e.g., for the purposes of throttling
   or rate limiting them, must issue one token for each redemption.

   The Anonymous Rate-Limited Credential (ARC) cryptographic protocol,
   as specified in [ARC], offers a more scalable approach to rate
   limiting.  In particular, ARC credentials can be issued once and then
   presented (or redeemed) up to some fixed-amount of time for distinct,
   per-origin presentation contexts.  This means that a Client will only
   be able to present a limited number of tokens associated with a given
   context.

   This document specifies the issuance and redemption protocols for
   ARC.  Section 2 describes motivation for this new type of token,
   Section 4 presents an overview of the protocols, and the remainder of
   the document specifies the protocols themselves.

2.  Motivation

   To demonstrate how ARC is useful, consider the case where a client
   wishes to keep its IP address private while accessing a service.  The
   client can hide its IP address using a proxy service or a VPN.
   However, doing so severely limits the client's ability to access
   services and content, since servers might not be able to enforce
   their policies without a stable and unique client identifier.

   With one-time-use tokens, the server can verify that each client
   access meets a particular bar for attestation, i.e., the bar that is
   enforced during issuance, but cannot be used by the server to rate
   limit a specific client.  This is because there is no mechanism in
   the issuance protocol to link repeated Client token requests in order
   to apply rate-limiting.

   There are several use cases for rate-limiting anonymous clients that
   are common on the Internet.  These routinely use client IP address
   tracking, among other characteristics, to implement rate-limiting.

   One example of this use case is rate-limiting website accesses to a
   client to help prevent abusive behavior.  Operations that are
   sensitive to abuse, such as account creation on a website or logging
   into an account, often employ rate-limiting as a defense-in-depth
   strategy.  Additional verification can be required by these pages
   when a client exceeds a set rate-limit.

3.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the terms Origin, Client, Issuer, and Token as
   defined in Section 2 of [ARCHITECTURE].  Moreover, the following
   additional terms are used throughout this document.

   *  Issuer Public Key: The public key (from a private-public key pair)
      used by the Issuer for issuing and verifying Tokens.

   *  Issuer Private Key: The private key (from a private-public key
      pair) used by the Issuer for issuing and verifying Tokens.

   Unless otherwise specified, this document encodes protocol messages
   in TLS notation from Section 3 of [TLS13].  Moreover, all constants
   are in network byte order.

   Encoding an integer to a sequence of bytes in network byte order is
   described using the function encode(n, v), where n is the number of
   bytes and v is the integer value.  The function len(x) returns the
   length in bytes of the byte string x.

4.  Protocol Overview

   The issuance and redemption protocols defined in this document are
   built on the Anonymous Rate-Limited Credential (ARC) protocol.  In
   contrast to the core Privacy Pass protocols which are one-time-use
   anonymous credentials, ARC allows clients to turn a single credential
   output from an issuance protocol into a fixed number of unlinkable
   tokens, each of which are bound to some agreed-upon public
   presentation context.

   With ARC, Clients receive TokenChallenge inputs from the redemption
   protocol ([AUTHSCHEME], Section 2.1).  If they have a valid
   credential for the designated Issuer, Clients can use the
   TokenChallenge to produce a single token for presentation.
   Otherwise, Clients invoke the issuance protocol to obtain a
   credential.  This interaction is shown below.

                                          +------------------------.
         +--------+        +----------+   |  +--------+ +--------+  |

             |                                              |

                 Figure 1: Issuance and Redemption Overview

   Similar to the core Privacy Pass protocols, the TokenChallenge can be
   interactive or non-interactive, and per-origin or cross-origin.

   ARC is only compatible with deployment models where the Issuer and
   Origin are operated by the same entity (see Section 4 of
   [ARCHITECTURE]), as tokens produced from a credential are not
   publicly verifiable.  The details of attestation are outside the
   scope of the issuance protocol; see Section 4 of [ARCHITECTURE] for
   information about how attestation can be implemented in each of the
   relevant deployment models.

   The issuance and redemption protocols in this document are built on
   [ARC].

5.  Configuration

   ARC Issuers are configured with key material used for issuance and
   token verification.  Concretely, Issuers run the SetupServer function
   from [ARC] to produce a private and public key, denoted skI and pkI,
   respectively.

   skI, pkI = SetupServer()

   The Issuer Public Key ID, denoted issuer_key_id, is computed as the
   SHA-256 hash of the Issuer Public Key, i.e., issuer_key_id = SHA-
   256(pkI_serialized), where pkI_serialized is the serialized version
   of pkI as described in Section 4.1 of [ARC].

6.  Token Challenge Requirements

   The ARC protocol uses a modified TokenChallenge structure from the
   one specified in [AUTHSCHEME].  In particular, the updated
   TokenChallenge structure is as follows:

   struct {
       uint16_t token_type = 0xE5AC; /* Type ARC(P-256) */
       opaque issuer_name<1..2^16-1>;
       opaque redemption_context<0..32>;
       opaque origin_info<0..2^16-1>;
       opaque credential_context<0..32>;
   } TokenChallenge;

   With the exception of credential_context, all fields are exactly as
   specified in Section 2.1.1 of [AUTHSCHEME].  The credential_context
   field is defined as follows:

   *  "credential_context" is a field that is either 0 or 32 bytes,
      prefixed with a single octet indicating the length (either 0 or
      32).  If value is non-empty, it is a 32-byte value generated by
      the origin that allows the origin to require that clients fetch
      credentials bound to a specific context.  Challenges with
      credential_context values of invalid lengths MUST be ignored.

   Similar to the redemption_context field, the credential_context is
   used to bind information to the credential.  This might be useful,
   for example, to enforce some expiration on the credential.  Origins
   might do this by constructing credential_context as F(current time
   window), where F is a pseudorandom function.  Semantically, this is
   equivalent to the Origin asking the Client for a token from a
   credential that is bound to "current time window."

   OPEN ISSUE: give more guidance about how to construct
   credential_context and redemption_context depending on the
   application's needs.

   In addition to this updated TokenChallenge, the HTTP authentication
   challenge also SHOULD contain the following additional attribute:

   *  "rate-limit", which contains a JSON number indicating the
      presentation limit to use for ARC.

   Implementation-specific steps: the client should store the Origin-
   provided input tokenChallenge so that when they receive a new
   tokenChallenge value, they can check if it has changed and which
   fields are different.  This will inform the client's behavior - for
   example, if credential_context is being used to enforce an expiration
   on the credential, then if the credential_context has changed, this
   can prompt the client to request a new credential.

7.  Credential Issuance Protocol

   Issuers provide an Issuer Private and Public Key, denoted skI and pkI
   respectively, used to produce tokens as input to the protocol.  See
   Section 5 for how these keys are generated.

   Clients provide the following as input to the issuance protocol:

   *  Issuer Request URL: A URL identifying the location to which
      issuance requests are sent.  This can be a URL derived from the
      "issuer-request-uri" value in the Issuer's directory resource, or
      it can be another Client-configured URL.  The value of this
      parameter depends on the Client configuration and deployment
      model.  For example, in the 'Joint Origin and Issuer' deployment
      model, the Issuer Request URL might correspond to the Client's
      configured Attester, and the Attester is configured to relay
      requests to the Issuer.

   *  Issuer name: An identifier for the Issuer.  This is typically a
      host name that can be used to construct HTTP requests to the
      Issuer.

   *  Issuer Public Key: pkI, with a key identifier token_key_id
      computed as described in Section 5.

   Given this configuration and these inputs, the two messages exchanged
   in this protocol to produce a credential are described below.

7.1.  Client-to-Issuer Request

   Given Origin-provided input tokenChallenge and the fixed-length
   Issuer Public Key ID issuer_key_id, the Client first creates a
   credential request message using the CreateCredentialRequest function
   from [ARC] as follows:

   request_context = concat(
     encode(2, len(tokenChallenge.issuer_name)),
     tokenChallenge.issuer_name,
     encode(2, len(tokenChallenge.origin_info)),
     tokenChallenge.origin_info,
     encode(2, len(tokenChallenge.credential_context)),
     tokenChallenge.credential_context,
     issuer_key_id)
   (clientSecrets, request) = CreateCredentialRequest(request_context)

   The Client then creates a CredentialRequest structure as follows:

   struct {
     uint16_t token_type = 0xE5AC; /* Type ARC(P-256) */
     uint8_t truncated_issuer_key_id;
     uint8_t encoded_request[Nrequest];
   } CredentialRequest;

   The structure fields are defined as follows:

   *  "token_type" is a 2-octet integer.

   *  "truncated_issuer_key_id" is the least significant byte of the
      issuer_key_id (Section 5) in network byte order (in other words,
      the last 8 bits of issuer_key_id).  This value is truncated so
      that Issuers cannot use issuer_key_id as a way of uniquely
      identifying Clients; see Section 9 and referenced information for
      more details.

   *  "encoded_request" is the Nrequest-octet request, computed as the
      serialization of the request value as defined in Section 4.2.1 of
      [ARC].

   The Client then generates an HTTP POST request to send to the Issuer
   Request URL, with the CredentialRequest as the content.  The media
   type for this request is "application/private-credential-request".
   An example request for the Issuer Request URL
   "https://issuer.example.net/request" is shown below.

   POST /request HTTP/1.1
   Host: issuer.example.net
   Accept: application/private-credential-response
   Content-Type: application/private-credential-request
   Content-Length: <Length of CredentialRequest>

   <Bytes containing the CredentialRequest>

7.2.  Issuer-to-Client Response

   Upon receipt of the request, the Issuer validates the following
   conditions:

   *  The CredentialRequest contains a supported token_type equal to
      value 0xE5AC.

   *  The CredentialRequest.truncated_token_key_id corresponds to the
      truncated key ID of an Issuer Public Key, with corresponding
      secret key skI, owned by the Issuer.

   *  The CredentialRequest.encoded_request is of the correct size
      (Nrequest).

   If any of these conditions is not met, the Issuer MUST return an HTTP
   422 (Unprocessable Content) error to the client.

   If these conditions are met, the Issuer then tries to deserialize
   CredentialRequest.encoded_request according to Section 4.2.1 of
   [ARC], yielding request.  If this fails, the Issuer MUST return an
   HTTP 422 (Unprocessable Content) error to the client.  Otherwise, if
   the Issuer is willing to produce a credential for the Client, the
   Issuer completes the issuance flow by an issuance response as
   follows:

   response = CreateCredentialResponse(skI, pkI, request)

   The Issuer then creates a CredentialResponse structured as follows:

   struct {
      uint8_t encoded_response[Nresponse];
   } CredentialResponse;

   The structure fields are defined as follows:

   *  "encoded_response" is the Nresponse-octet encoded issuance
      response message, computed as the serialization of response as
      specified in Section 4.2.2 of [ARC].

   The Issuer generates an HTTP response with status code 200 whose
   content consists of CredentialResponse, with the content type set as
   "application/private-credential-response".

   HTTP/1.1 200 OK
   Content-Type: application/private-credential-response
   Content-Length: <Length of CredentialResponse>

   <Bytes containing the CredentialResponse>

7.3.  Credential Finalization

   Upon receipt, the Client handles the response and, if successful,
   deserializes the content values CredentialResponse.encoded_response
   according to Section 4.2.2 of [ARC] yielding response.  If
   deserialization fails, the Client aborts the protocol.  Otherwise,
   the Client processes the response as follows:

  credential = FinalizeCredential(clientSecrets, pkI, request, response)

   The Client then saves the credential structure, associated with the
   given Issuer Name, to use when producing Token values in response to
   future token challenges.

8.  Token Redemption Protocol

   The token redemption protocol takes as input TokenChallenge and
   presentation limit values from [AUTHSCHEME], Section 2.1; the
   presentation limit is sent as an additional attribute within the HTTP
   challenge as described in Section 6.  Clients use credentials from
   the issuance protocol in producing tokens bound to the
   TokenChallenge.  The process for producing a token in this way, as
   well as verifying a resulting token, is described in the following
   sections.

8.1.  Token Creation

   Given a TokenChallenge value as input, denoted challenge, a
   presentation limit, denoted presentation_limit, and a previously
   computed credential that is valid for the Issuer identifier in the
   challenge, denoted credential, Clients compute a credential
   presentation value as follows:

presentation_context = concat(
  encode(2, len(challenge.issuer_name)),
  challenge.issuer_name,
  encode(2, len(challenge.origin_info)),
  challenge.origin_info,
  encode(2, len(challenge.redemption_context)),
  challenge.redemption_context,
  issuer_key_id)
state = MakePresentationState(credential, presentation_context, presentation_limit)
newState, nonce, presentation = Present(state)

   Subsequent presentations MUST use the updated state, denoted
   newState.  Reusing the original state will break the presentation
   unlinkability properties of ARC; see Section 9.

   The resulting Token value is then constructed as follows:

   struct {
       uint16_t token_type = 0xE5AC; /* Type ARC(P-256) */
       uint32_t presentation_nonce;
       uint8_t challenge_digest[32];
       uint8_t issuer_key_id[Nid];
       uint8_t presentation[Npresentation];
   } Token;

   The structure fields are defined as follows:

   *  "token_type" is a 2-octet integer, in network byte order, equal to
      0xE5AC.

   *  "presentation_nonce" is a 4-octet integer, in network byte order,
      equal to the nonce output from ARC.

   *  "challenge_digest" is a 32-octet value containing the hash of the
      original TokenChallenge, SHA-256(TokenChallenge).

   *  "issuer_key_id" is a Nid-octet identifier for the Issuer Public
      Key, computed as defined in Section 5.

   *  "presentation" is a Npresentation-octet presentation, set to the
      serialized presentation value (see Section 4.3.2 of [ARC] for
      serialiation details).

8.2.  Token Verification

   Given a deserialized presentation from the token, denoted
   presentation and obtained by deserializing a presentation according
   to Section 4.3.2 of [ARC], a presentation limit, denoted
   presentation_limit, a fixed-length Issuer Public Key ID, denoted
   issuer_key_id, a presentation nonce from a token, denoted nonce, and
   the digest of a token challenge, denoted challenge_digest, verifying
   a Token requires invoking the VerifyPresentation function from
   Section 4.3.3 of [ARC] in the following ways:

   request_context = concat(
     encode(2, len(tokenChallenge.issuer_name)),
     tokenChallenge.issuer_name,
     encode(2, len(tokenChallenge.origin_info)),
     tokenChallenge.origin_info,
     encode(2, len(tokenChallenge.credential_context)),
     tokenChallenge.credential_context,
     issuer_key_id)

   presentation_context = concat(
     encode(2, len(tokenChallenge.issuer_name)),
     tokenChallenge.issuer_name,
     encode(2, len(tokenChallenge.origin_info)),
     tokenChallenge.origin_info,
     encode(2, len(tokenChallenge.redemption_context)),
     tokenChallenge.redemption_context,
     issuer_key_id)

   valid = VerifyPresentation(
     skI,
     pkI,
     request_context,
     presentation_context,
     nonce,
     presentation,
     presentation_limit)

   This function returns True if the CredentialToken is valid, and False
   otherwise.

   To prevent double spending, the Origin SHOULD perform a check that
   the tag output from VerifyPresentation has not previously been seen.
   It can do this by checking the tag against previously seen tags.  To
   improve double spend performance, the Origin can store and look up
   tags corresponding to the associated request_context and
   presentation_context values.

9.  Security Considerations

   Privacy considerations for tokens based on deployment details, such
   as issuer configuration and issuer selection, are discussed in
   Section 6.1 of [ARCHITECTURE].  Note that ARC requires a joint Origin
   and Issuer configuration given that it is privately verifiable.

   ARC offers Origin-Client unlinkability, Issuer-Client unlinkability,
   and redemption context unlinkability, as described in Section 3.3 of
   [ARCHITECTURE], with one exception.  While redemption context
   unlinkability is achieved by re-randomizing credentials every time
   they are presented as tokens, there is a reduction in the anonymity
   set in the case of presentation nonce collisions, as detailed in
   Section 7.2 of [ARC].
